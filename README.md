# Plant_Disease_Detection

Plant_Disease_Detection is a deep learning project developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect diseases in plants. The project uses Keras and TensorFlow for training the model and Streamlit for presenting the results.

## Features

- Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks to train a deep learning model.
- Predicts diseases in plants based on images.
- Can be used by farmers in agriculture to identify plant diseases.

## Installation

1. Download the zip of this project and extract it.
2. Open the project in Google Colab or Visual Studio Code.
3. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Streamlit App.
   ```sh
   streamlit run main_app.py

## Usage
To use the app, upload an image of a plant, and the app will predict the disease affecting the plant.
